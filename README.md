## Responsive React App Built With MongoDB Schema 
 
![ERD Diagram](/client/build/images/userInterface-ERD.png)

This project was a simple full-stack application I built to learn how the different parts of a web app connect and work together. I used React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and MongoDB with Mongoose to manage the database. The main goal was to understand how to create routes, send data back and forth between the client and server, and store that data using a database schema.
